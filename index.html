<p align="center">Hello! My name is Kara Kelley. I am currently enrolled in the Learning Design and Technology Program at the University of South Florida. I earned a BS in Psychology with a minor in Criminal Justice from Troy University in 2011. I have been a virtual English teacher since 2017. In that time I have expanded my role to include working on advisory councils and as a corporate trainer, preparing incoming teachers.  </p>

<p align="center">Outside of education and work, I am a mother to 5 beautiful daughters and an adopted sister. In my freetime I like to read, run, eat and play board games with my children. I also enjoy gl-amping, having beach days and going to Disney World. I volunteer in a local sports league as the head coach for two recreational soccer teams. </p>

<p align="center">I hope you enjoy this look into my assignments for Web Programming 1.</p>
