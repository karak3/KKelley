<p>Hello! My name is Kara Kelley. I am currently enrolled in the Learning Design and Technology Program at the University of South Florida. I earned a BS in Psychology with a minor in Criminal Justice from Troy University in 2011.   </p>

<p>I am a mother to 5 beautiful daughters and an adopted sister. In my freetime I like to read, run, eat and play board games with my children. I also enjoy gl-amping, having beach days and going to Disney World.  </p>
